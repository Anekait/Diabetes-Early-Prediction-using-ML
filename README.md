# Diabetes-Early-Prediction-using-ML

## Based on paper “A model for early prediction of diabetes” -

## Problem Statement:
Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also creators of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. So, the objective of this project is to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this study is originally taken from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases ( publicly available at: UCI ML Repository https://data.world/uci/pima-indians-diabetes or
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database ).

## Models used:
1. Artificial Neural Network (paper)
2. Random forest (paper)
3. Logistic Regression (additional)
4. Decision Tree (additional)
5. Support Vector Machine (additional)
